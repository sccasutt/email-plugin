The Thunderbird plugin will be written in JavaScript, as Thunderbird plugins are typically written in this language. The plugin will use the OpenAI GPT API to generate responses to emails. The plugin will also use the Thunderbird API to interact with the email client.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `EmailResponseGenerator`: This class will handle the generation of email responses. It will have the following methods:
    - `getPreviousEmails`: This method will retrieve previous emails from the same sender.
    - `generateResponse`: This method will generate a response to an email using the OpenAI GPT API.
2. `EmailSender`: This class will handle sending emails. It will have the following methods:
    - `composeEmail`: This method will compose an email with the recipient and response pre-filled.
    - `sendEmail`: This method will send the composed email.
3. `PluginUI`: This class will handle the user interface of the plugin. It will have the following methods:
    - `showResponseButton`: This method will display the "Generate Response" button.
    - `showToneSelection`: This method will display the options for selecting the tone of the response.
    - `showInformationInput`: This method will display a textbox for the user to input any specific information to be included in the response.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
